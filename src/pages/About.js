                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    OpenAI was established in December 2015 by a group of influential tech visionaries and AI researchers, including Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, John Schulman, and Wojciech Zaremba, among others. The idea behind OpenAI was to create a non-profit organization that would promote and develop AI in a way that prioritizes positive societal impact over profit motives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time, OpenAI evolved its organizational structure and funding model. In 2019, OpenAI became a for-profit company, OpenAI LP, with the goal of attracting additional investment to support its ambitious research and development efforts. Despite this change, the company's commitment to its core principles remained unwavering.

                <h2>Contributions to AI Research</h2>
                <p>
                    OpenAI has been at the forefront of AI research, achieving numerous breakthroughs in various domains. One of its most significant contributions was the development of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language models. GPT-2, released in 2019, showcased the remarkable ability of language models to generate human-like text and sparked discussions on the potential misuse of such technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Building on the success of GPT-2, OpenAI introduced GPT-3, which took natural language processing to new heights. GPT-3, released in 2020, boasted an impressive 175 billion parameters, making it one of the largest and most powerful language models at the time. Its versatility and capacity for understanding context led to a wide range of applications, from chatbots to content generation.
